Founded in 2015 in Riga, Latvia, by Artis Kehris, Gatis Dukurs, and James Berdigans, Printify has grown into a global platform serving millions of users. It is a print-on-demand platform that connects you with print providers from around the world. You create designs, pick the products you want to sell—like t-shirts, hoodies, mugs, or posters—and Printify handles the printing and shipping once someone places an order. You don’t have to buy anything in advance or keep any stock.

One of the best things about Printify is that it works with many printing partners in different countries. This means your products can be made and delivered faster, depending on where your customer lives. It also gives you more choices when it comes to price, quality, and shipping speed.

**Printify** easily connects with popular eCommerce platforms like Shopify, Etsy, and WooCommerce. Once your store is set up, Printify can automatically send customer orders to a print provider, who will then print and ship the item straight to your buyer. You don’t have to do anything manually, which saves you time and effort.

Printify also has a free plan, so you can start without paying anything. If you want bigger profit margins, the Premium plan offers up to 20% off product costs.

**5. Automated Order Fulfillment**

**6. Custom Branding Options**

You can add your own branding to orders with features like custom packing slips, available from select print providers. This helps build a consistent brand experience, even though you're not handling the packaging or shipping yourself.

Printify’s built-in mockup generator creates professional product images for your store. These mockups show how your design looks on the item, giving customers a clear idea of what they’re buying. You can use these images on your website, social media, or ads.

**8. Discounts with Premium Plan**

If you're selling a lot of products, Printify Premium can help you save money. It gives you up to 20% off the base cost of products, which increases your profit margins. The Premium plan is great for sellers who want to scale up and make more per sale.

**9. Real-Time Order Tracking**

Both you and your customers can track orders with real-time shipping updates. This reduces support requests and helps build trust, since customers always know where their package is and when it will arrive.

**10. Transparent Pricing and No Upfront Costs**

With Printify, there are no hidden fees. You don’t pay anything upfront on the free plan. You only pay when a customer places an order. Product and shipping prices are shown clearly before you add anything to your store, so you always know your costs.

**11. API Access for Developers**

If you're a developer or have a custom store setup, Printify offers a public API. This allows you to create custom workflows or integrate Printify into more complex systems. It's useful for businesses that want more control over their print-on-demand operations.

These features make Printify a reliable and easy-to-use platform for anyone who wants to start selling custom products without handling production or shipping.
